    <!--Student Answer Section-->
    <!-- Directions for completing -->
    <p>Directions: Identify which type of programmer(Front End, Back end, Mobile Programmer or Data Analyst) would work on the features of Project Compass. Type your answers between the paragraph tags and be sure to provide an brief explanation for your choice.</p>

    <!-- Question 1 -->
    <p>1. Which programmer would build and manage the database for storing map pin locations in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 1 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back end programmer<p>
      <p>Relational databases is one of the top priorities of backend programmers; in dynamic web pages, most of the content is produced on flight by the exploration of big data bases. While front end programmers specialize in how this information is displayed, back end programmers manage the server applications, as the databases, with which user does not interact directly, but are supporting all of his experience in the web navigation.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 2 -->
    <p>2. Which programmer would make Project Compass responsive on different screen sizes on the web?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 2 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front end programmer<p>
      <p>Front end programmers are responsible for the user experience while interacting with a website. Is their labor to give the user the best possible experience, no matter what his device is, so they use responsive web design as a tool to make the page accesible.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <p>3. Which type of mobile programmer (Android or iOS) would be using Swift to turn Project Compass into a mobile app?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 3 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>iOS programmer<p>
      <p>Android uses Java (and perhaps C++); iOS uses swift and objective C.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <p>4. Which programmer would add the image <img class="compass_icon"src="img/compass.svg"> to Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 4 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Frontend programmer<p>
      <p>Images are part of how the web page is displayed, and this is responsability of the front end programmer. He also gives the structure to the content, so is his job to put the <code>&lt;img></code> element in the HTML document.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 5 -->
    <p>5. Who would evaluate information about Project Compass users to give insights for product decisions?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 5 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data analyst<p>
      <p>The visitors of the website will produce a lot of data; handling it, and getting useful information fromt there is responsibility of data analyst. The obtained information could serve the team as a way to take decisions in the future - data driven decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 6-->
    <p>6. Who would make requests to the Google Maps API in Project Compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 6 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Front end programmer<p>
      <p>APIs are ways to make the applications talk to each other; in this case, a front end developer would display information on a map to the user, using the Google Maps API.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 7 -->
    <p>7. Which programmer would need to consider hardware components to make Project Compass usable with a microphone or camera?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 7 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Mobile programmer<p>
      <p>In web applications, the browser (and the underlying layers, like the OS) handles all of the hardware components. In mobile development, hardware management becomes part of the labor of the programmer, which requires additional effort from the programmer, but also gives a lot of possibilities.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 8 -->
    <p>8. Which programmer would make a post request endpoint to add comments onto Project compass?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 8 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Back end programmer<p>
      <p>The back end programmer is responsible for planning the response that the server gives to user requests. The back end programmer will plan the requests that the clients will make to the server while sending forms (like a comment on a website), and the response the server will give to the client. According to this planeation, he will specify to the front end programmer how to send the requests, through <code>&lt;form></code> elements, and <code>action - name - type - id</code> attributes.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 9 -->
    <p>9. Which programmer would look at user clicking rates on Project Compass to make recommendations for external tourism sites?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 9 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data analyst<p>
      <p>This is part of the data produced by the visitors, and requires some statisctical techniques to obtain trends and useful information.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Question 10 -->
    <p>10. After evaluating these four different paths into programming, which role are you most interested in pursuing? Why?</p>
    <!--Your Answer to question 10 goes here-->
    <div class= "answer">
      <p>Data Analysis<p>
      <p>I come from the healthcare field, and I am very interested in being able to use
        current computing capabilities and new statistical approaches to the huge amounts of data produced in healthcare, as a tool to take decisions in clinical sciences but also in public health and policy making. </p>
